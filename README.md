# Simple Q/A chatbot

Welcome to my First Chatbot Project! This is a simple chatbot built to engage with users, providing conversational responses. The chatbot can be customized for various applications like customer service, personal assistants, or even fun conversation starters.

This chatbot can have errors and glitches as it is my first chatbot project. So, sorry for any inconvience caused.

## Installation and Dependencise
  1. Make a virtual env in python 
```bash
  python -m venv <env-name>
```
  2. Install streamlit and groq library
```bash
  <env-name>/bin/pip install streamlit groq
```
  3. Create an api-key then, create an .env file and store your api-key there
```bash
  GROQ_API_KEY = "your-api-key"
```
  4. To run the file(app.py) in your localhost
```bash
  streamlit run app.py
```
## Lessons Learned

I have learned how to implement streamlit for making user-interfaces using python and Groq which I used to generate response using thier inference API.
